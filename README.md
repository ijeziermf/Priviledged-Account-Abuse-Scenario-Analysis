# Scenario-Based Cyber Risk Analysis (Priviledged Account Abuse)

**Overview**

This project documents a scenario-based cyber risk analysis focused on privileged account abuse within a simulated organization. The objective was to evaluate how misuse or compromise of elevated access could translate into material business risk, including operational disruption, data exposure, and regulatory impact. Rather than assessing controls in isolation, this analysis traces a realistic threat pathway from initial access misuse through business-level consequences to support executive decision-making and risk prioritization.

**Technologies & Tools Used**

- Microsoft Word (formal risk analysis report)
- NIST SP 800-53
- Organization-defined 5×5 impact and likelihood risk matrix
- Scenario-based risk assessment methodology
- Quantitative risk scoring (Impact × Likelihood)

**Deliverable Features**

- Scenario-based cyber risk narrative
- Defined threat pathway and attack progression
- Asset and data impact identification
- Quantitative inherent risk scoring using a 5×5 matrix
- Business-focused impact and likelihood analysis
- Risk treatment options with a clear recommended decision
- Executive-ready summary language

**Notes for Reviewers**

This analysis intentionally prioritizes clarity and business relevance over technical depth. Plain English is used to describe threat scenarios, impacts, and decisions to ensure accessibility for executive and non-technical stakeholders. Formal risk concepts and NIST-aligned structure are applied to maintain consistency, defensibility, and alignment with industry risk management practices without over-reliance on control-level detail.

**Process (Start to Finish)**

The project began by defining a realistic cyber risk scenario involving privileged account abuse and identifying the systems, data, and business functions at risk. A threat pathway was developed to demonstrate how misuse of elevated access could escalate into broader organizational impact. Impact and likelihood were assessed using a five-by-five risk matrix to calculate inherent risk and support consistent prioritization. Risk treatment options were evaluated based on their ability to reduce likelihood and improve detection, culminating in a mitigation-focused recommendation designed to align with organizational risk tolerance and governance expectations.

**Key Takeaways & Discoveries**

- Privileged access represents one of the highest-impact cyber risk categories when governance and monitoring are insufficient.
- Scenario-based analysis provides clearer insight than control-only assessments.
- Quantitative scoring strengthens risk prioritization and executive credibility.
- Effective cyber risk analysis focuses on decisions, not just technical findings.

**Deep Dive: Why Scenario-Based Analysis Matters**

Scenario-based cyber risk analysis bridges the gap between technical security issues and business decision-making. By tracing how a specific threat could realistically unfold, this approach helps leadership understand not just what controls are missing, but why the risk matters and where attention should be focused. This method supports more informed prioritization than abstract risk statements or control checklists alone.

**Value to Cyber Risk Management**

This project demonstrates how scenario-based analysis can be used to identify, quantify, and communicate cyber risk in a way that supports governance, prioritization, and executive oversight. It highlights the role of cyber risk analysis as a decision-support function rather than a purely technical or compliance-driven exercise.

**Growth & Next Improvements**

This project strengthened my ability to evaluate cyber risk through a business and governance lens. Future iterations could expand this analysis to include additional scenarios such as third-party vendor breaches or cloud misconfiguration, as well as integration with formal risk registers or GRC platforms to support ongoing monitoring and enterprise-scale risk management.
